          Hello! I am Rares, a computer science student from Augsburg, Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
          I moved to Germany in 10th grade from my home in Sibiu, Romania and
          enrolled at the NÃ¶rdlingen Gymnasium. I did not know any german, so I
          had to learn it as soon as possible in order to finish my Abitur. I
          was very determined to learn german and finish my highschool with a
          good grade. With a lot of hard work and determination I have managed
          to achieve a good grade.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this I have moved to Augsburg to study Computer Science at the
          University. I have learned a lot about object oriented programming,
          the SOLID programming principles, java, python, machine learning and
          many other things. One of my favourite courses was about machine
          learning in the field of computer vision, where I coded different
          projects about object detection from pictures. I have finished my
          bachelors degree with the best grade 1.0 with a thesis about a large
          language model, which takes audio samples as input, generates a
          description and finally categorizes this description with zero-shot
          text classification, in order to determine whether the description
          matches the expected sound events.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the last year I have been learning core concepts about Web
          Development, such as React. My main goal is to improve my programming
          knowledge and become a better programmer.
